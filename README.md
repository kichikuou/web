This is the source code for [Kichikuou on Web](https://kichikuou.github.io/web/) website.

### Subdirectories

#### shell
The source code for the JavaScript part of the site, which is responsive for:

* Loading CD images
* User interface (toolbar, dialogs, etc.)
* Low-level platform code, such as audio playback

Node.js is required to build. You can build them with the following command:

    $ npm install
    $ npm run build-shell

#### scss
The source code for the site's stylesheet. You can build it with the following command:

    $ npm install
    $ npm run build-css

#### fslib
A dummy Emscripten program to allow access to save files stored in the Emscripten file system, before loading the game engine (system3 or xsystem35).

#### docs
The directory published as https://kichikuou.github.io/web/. It contains static files such as HTML, and compiled JavaScript / WASM / CSS files.
`system3.*` files are built from [system3-sdl2](https://github.com/kichikuou/system3-sdl2), and `xsystem35.*` files are built from [xsystem35-sdl2](https://github.com/kichikuou/xsystem35-sdl2).

During development, serve this directory with any local http server.

If you want to run a game that uses MIDI, one additional set up step is needed. Run this command in the `docs` directory:
```
git clone -b gh-pages https://github.com/kichikuou/timidity.git
```
