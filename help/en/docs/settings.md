# Settings

## Screen

Zoom
:   Adjusts the zoom level of the game screen. When set to “Auto,” the game screen is automatically resized to fit the window.

Pixelated zoom
:   Normally, colors are smoothed when scaling up the screen. Enabling this option disables that smoothing, preserving the original pixel art style. Recommended if you prefer the retro, pixelated look.

Font antialiasing
:   Applies anti-aliasing to make text appear smoother. If text appears blurry, turning this off may improve readability.

    !!! Note
        Changes to this setting won’t affect already displayed text. It will apply to text shown afterward.

## Text Skip
Skip unread text
:   When enabled, all messages will be skipped regardless of whether they have been read. When disabled, only previously read messages will be skipped.

Turn off at unread text
:   Automatically cancels message skipping when an unread message is displayed.

Turn off at menu
:   Cancels skipping when a choice prompt appears.

Click to turn off
:   Cancels skipping when the screen is clicked. Some games may register unintended clicks, so disable this option if necessary.
