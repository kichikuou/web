## Screen

Zoom
:   Adjusts the zoom level of the game screen. When set to “Auto,” the game screen is automatically resized to fit the window.

Pixelated zoom
:   Normally, colors are smoothed when scaling up the screen. Enabling this option disables that smoothing, preserving the original pixel art style. Recommended if you prefer the retro, pixelated look.

Font antialiasing
:   Applies anti-aliasing to make text appear smoother. If text appears blurry, turning this off may improve readability.

    !!! Note
        Changes to this setting won’t affect already displayed text. It will apply to text shown afterward.

## Text Skip

Turn off at unread text

Turn off at menu
