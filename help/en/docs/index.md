# Overview

**Kichikuou on Web** is a project that ports AliceSoft's System3 / System3.5 game engines to run in a web browser, making it easy to play games distributed under the [royalty-free declaration](https://www.alicesoft.com/about/#cont08).

This project began with the hope of lowering the barriers to playing these wonderful games, which are offered for free but often require virtual CD software and other cumbersome setups.

It runs in the supported browsers listed below. Please use the latest version whenever possible:

- Google Chrome (Windows / Mac / Android / ChromeOS)
- Mozilla Firefox
- Safari (Mac / iOS / iPadOS)
- Microsoft Edge
- Opera
