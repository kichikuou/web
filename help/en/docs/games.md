### MSX Games

Among the titles declared free for distribution, the following MSX games are not supported on this site, but can be played in your browser using WebMSX, a separate site:

- Little PRINCESS
- Gakuen Senki

Follow these steps to play:

1. Download the "MSX2/2+ Disk Image" from [AliceSoft Archives](http://retropc.net/alice/).
2. Open the [WebMSX](https://webmsx.org/?M=MSX2PJ) page and drag & drop the downloaded ZIP file onto it.
3. Click the power icon at the bottom left and select "Reset" from the menu to restart. The disk image will be loaded, and the game will start.
4. For *Little PRINCESS*, you need to enable CAPS and KANA on the MSX keyboard for text input. By default, these are mapped to the <kbd>NonConvert</kbd> and <kbd>PageDown</kbd> keys respectively (you can change them in "Help & Settings").

## Games Not Covered by the Royalty-Free Declaration

Even if a game isn’t part of the free distribution declaration, you can still play it on this site if it's supported by the xsystem35 or system3-sdl2 engines and you have the CD image or ZIP archive yourself.
